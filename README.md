# OOP-Python

Welcome to the `OOP-Python` project! This repository is a hands-on demonstration of various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Through this project, I have explored and applied different OOP principles, including class methods, static methods, class attributes, inheritance, and encapsulation. Below is an overview of what I learned and accomplished with each part of the project.

## Learning Outcomes

### 1. **Class and Static Methods**

  - **Outcome:** I explored the use of class and static methods to understand their differences and appropriate use cases. 
  - I learned that class methods operate on the class itself rather than instance-specific data. For example, `instantiate_from_something()` manipulates data to create class instances.
  - I learned that static methods, like `is_integer()`, do not modify class or instance state but can perform utility functions related to the class.

### 2. **Class Attributes**

  - **Outcome:** I learned how to utilize class attributes to share data across all instances of a class. 
  - The `pay_rate` and `all` attributes in the `Item` class demonstrated how to manage and access shared data.

### 3. **Class Inheritance**

  - **Outcome:** I gained insight into class inheritance by extending the `Item` class to create a `Phone` class.
  - This exercise helped me understand how to inherit and extend functionalities, such as overriding class attributes and adding new features specific to subclasses.

### 4. **Clean Code and Encapsulation**

  - **Outcome:** I applied principles of clean code and encapsulation to refactor the `Item` class.
  - By using private attributes and property decorators, I ensured controlled access to attributes. This also involved implementing methods for applying discounts and increments and setting attribute constraints.

### 5. **Polymorphism**

  - **Outcome:** I explored polymorphism by creating a function that handles different types of objects. This demonstrated how a single function can operate on various data types seamlessly.

### 6. **Constructors and `__init__` Method**

  - **Outcome** I learned the role of constructors and the `__init__` method in initializing object attributes and validating input data.
  - he exercise emphasized the importance of validation and proper initialization in object-oriented design.

### 7. **Getters and Setters**

  - **Outcome** I implemented getters and setters using property decorators to manage attribute access and enforce validation rules.
  - This approach allowed me to create read-only attributes and control how attributes are modified, ensuring data integrity.
